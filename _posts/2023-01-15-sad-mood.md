During the learning of the course AADS, I gradually found I am a person that not good at maths. I was always far behind when compared with my classmates. Not so smart, and not so hard-working.

I quickly reviewed the veb tree, npc, and exact exponential algorithm, but I am unsure whether I truly understood that. I feel so confused about my future....
