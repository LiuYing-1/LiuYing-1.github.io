Today, I had the pleasure of spending Easter lunch with my Danish family. We indulged in a delightful spread of delectable dishes and various types of snaps, which we enjoyed throughout the afternoon.

As the day progressed, we shared in some lively dancing and singing, which made the atmosphere even more festive and enjoyable. It was truly a wonderful and cozy day spent with loved ones.
