My friend <b>Jianxiang Yu</b> came to visit me during Christmas. <b>Runfei Wu</b> and I brought him to visit a lot of attractions in Copenhagen on the first day, including the <b>Little Mermaid</b>, <b>Nyhavn</b>, <b>Kongens Nytorv</b> and <b>Grundtvigs Kirke</b>. In the evening, we had dinner with danish neighbors.
