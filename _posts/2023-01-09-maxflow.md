## Part 1

- Max-flow is an algorithm that we can solve in polynomial time => It is fast and good.

- **_What is a max-flow problem?_**

_Before that, we are about to know what is the flow network._

- **_What is the flow network?_**

Draw a picture

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

    </div>
</div>

Basically, we have a starting point or a **_source_** called S, and an end point T called **_sink_**. There are some cities each vertex including s and t. => **_s and t_**

- **_transport goods_**

(1) We can imagine that we are transporting goods from s here to t,

(2) but it is **_not allowed_** to accumulate goods in these intermediate cities. => **_So, whatever goes into a city or in vertex has to go out again except for S & T_**.

- **_Flow Conservation_**

We can also think of it as a system of water pipes. So, you want to send as much water from S to T as possible. But there is a **_limit_**. => In addition, to have what is called **_flow conservation_**, **_whatever goes in has to go out_** in the above four nodes.

- **_Capacities_**

_We also have these numbers on the edges of the graph. And these numbers are called capacities._

For instance, $7$ means that we can send in most seven units of whatever we want to send per unit of time. => Litter of water or Number of trucks per day.

- **_Application_**

The max-flow problem **_can be used as a black box inside algorithms for other problems_**. So if we can solve the max-flow problem, we can use an algorithm for that to help solve other problems.

- **_Formally Definition of Flow Network_** => $(G, s, t, c)$, no self-loops and no antiparallel edges.

A flow network consists of a directed graph $G=(V, E)$, a source $s\in V$, a sink $t \in V \setminus \{s\}$, and a capacity $fn: c. V\times V \to \R$ such that $c(u, v) \ge 0, \forall{u, v\in V}$, and if $(u, v)\not\in E$ then $c(u, v) = 0$.

Note: <u>C. It maps vertex pairs to real numbers.</u> <u>Capacities can never be negative.</u> <u>If we have a vertex pair that is not an edge of the graph, then the capacity has to be 0.</u>

_Now we have a flow network but what we want to find in a flow network is a flow._

- **_Special requirement_** for $G$

Before we continue, we should declare one thing.

We require that $G$ has no self-loops and no anti-parallel edges.

_Self-loop means an edge with the endpoints equal to each other. So it connects a vertex to itself._

_Antiparallel edges mean that you have a pair of distinct vertices that have edges in opposite directions._ => Solution is to add an extra vertex.

- **_Flow_**

**_Definition of Flow_** => <font color=red>A flow is a function takes pairs of vertices maps them to real number the flow values. And it should satisfy the following constraints.</font>

A flow in $G$ is a $fn: f.V\times V\to \R$ such that,

1. $0\le f(u, v)\le c(u, v), \forall{u, v\in V}$ and this is **_Capacity Constraints_**.

2. $\sum_{v\in V}f(u, v)=\sum_{v\in V}f(v, u), \forall{u\in V\setminus\{s, t\}} \Leftrightarrow\sum_{(u, v)\in E} f(u, v) = \sum_{(v, u)\in E}f(v, u)$ and this is **_Flow Conservation._**

   **_Why it is equivalent?_**

   We have zero capacity on all pairs that are not connect all ordered pairs that don't correspond to an edge. So whether we sum over all the edges makes no difference because there is no contribution from this u, v is not in edge and the same on the right side.

If we have these two types of requirements satisfied, then we call this function of flow.

- **_Quality of our flow_**

However, in the example, we want to transport as much as possible from $s \to t$. So we need to define something that expresses how good our flow is.

The value $|f|$ of $f$ is defined as $|f|=\sum_{v\in V}\left(f(s, v)-f(v, s)\right)$ => (total flow leaving s - total flow entering s).

- **_What is Max-flow?_**

**_A max-flow is a flow of maximum value_**. We want to maximize the equation above.

- **_Candidate flow and the_** $|f|$

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
		 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ri4Hhk6.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable>
    </div>
</div>

The first one is not a flow as it violates the capacity constraint. The second one is not a flow as it violates the flow conservation where the right bottom node, 7 in and 6 out.

The third one is a flow with $|f|=7$, as the source sends out 7 units, while there is nothing in the source. The fourth one is a flow with $|f|=9$.

- **_How do we find such a maximum flow?_**

_To solve this question, we need to be familiar with the following concepts first._

- **_Residual Capacity_** => <font color=red>Why do we need the special requirement above?</font>

Given flow $f$ in $G$, the residual capacity $c_f: V\times V \to \R$ is defined as,

$$
c_f(u, v) = \begin{cases}
c(u, v) - f(u, v), \quad if \ (u, v) \in E \\
f(v, u), \quad  if \ (v,u) \in E => cancellation \\
0, \quad otherwise
\end{cases}
$$

- **_Residual Network_**

The residual network $G_f = (V, E_f)$ where $E_f = \{(u, v)\in V \times V | c_f(u, v)>0 \}$.

$G_f$ is a flow network with a capacity function $c_f$. $G_f$ is allowed to have antiparallel edges.

- **_Practice_**

  <div class="row mt-3">
      <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
  		 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2XKQYuw.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable>
      </div>
  </div>

_Then, let's go back how to find a maximum flow._

**Ford-Fulkerson(G)** => Informal

1. $f\leftarrow0$ => It initializes the flow to be 0 everywhere.

2. while there is an augmenting path $p = s\leadsto t$ in $G_f$

   find a max flow $f_p$ along $p$. (We need to find the bottleneck, the below example is $f_p=2$)

   <div class="row mt-3">
       <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
   		 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ncWLauT.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable>
       </div>
   </div>

   $f\leftarrow f\uparrow f_p$ ($f$ is augmented with $f_P$)

3. return $f$

_Here we only call it a method instead of an algorithm is that we don't specify how we pick this augmenting path._

_Right now, let's define this augmentation symbol._

- **_Augmented Flow_**

Given flow $f$ in $G$ and given flow $f'$ in $G_f$. => $f'$ is what we called $f_p$ before. => <font color=blue>But why do we need to minus the flow that we send in the opposite direction?</font>

Then the augmented flow $f\uparrow f': V\times V \to \R$ is,

$$
(f\uparrow f')(u, v) = \begin{cases*}
f(u, v)+f'(u, v)-f'(v, u),\quad if \ (u, v) \in E \\
0, \quad otherwise
\end{cases*}
$$

- **_Augmented Practice_**

  <div class="row mt-3">
      <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
  		 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jJrHoXY.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable>
      </div>
  </div>

- **_Max-flow-min-cut Theorem_**

_Why the Ford-Fulkerson can find the max-flow? There is a theorem which is called max-flow-min-cut theorem._

_Before we state the theorem, there are still some definitions._

- **_Cut_**

A cut is a partition of $V$ into subsets $S$ and $T$ such that $s\in S$ and $t\in T$.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
		 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/90NBg1N.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable>
    </div>
</div>

- **_Net Flow_** => <font color=red>The total flow going from $S \to T$ minus the total flow going from $T\to S$.</font>

Given a cut $(S, T)$, we define the net flow across $(S, T)$ as $f(S, T)=\sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T}(f(u, v)-f(v, u))$.

- **_Capacity of the Cut_** => <font color=red>We only look at the edges going from $S \to T$ and add the capacities.</font>

The capacity $c(S, T)$ is $c(S, T)=\sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T}c(u, v)$.

- **_Lemma 1_**

$f\uparrow f'$ is a flow in $G$ of value $|f\uparrow f'|=|f|+|f'|$.

**Proof**

_How do we show this is a flow first?_ => **_Capacity Constraints_**

Let $(u, v)\in E$. Then,

$$
(f\uparrow f')(u, v) = f(u,v)+ f'(u, v) - f'(v, u) \\
\le f(u, v) + c_f(u, v) - 0 \\
= f(u, v) + c(u, v) - f(u, v)
= c(u, v)
$$

$$
(f\uparrow f')(u, v) = f(u, v) + f'(u, v) -f'(v, u) \\
\ge f(u, v) - c_f(v, u) => ignore \ the \ 2^{nd} \ term \\
= f(u, v) - f(u, v) = 0
$$

Then, => **_Flow Conservation_**

Let $u\in V \setminus \{s, t\}$. Then,

$$
\sum_{(u, v) \in E}(f\uparrow f')(u, v) - \sum_{(v, u)\in E}(f\uparrow f')(v, u) = \sum_{(u, v)\in E}(f(u, v)+ f'(u, v)-f'(v, u)) - \sum_{(v, u)\in E}(f(v, u)+ f'(v, u)-f'(u, v)) \\
$$

The first term can be canceled as they represent the flow going out from $u$ and going in to $u$. => **_Flow Conservation_**

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
		 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5L0JWFz.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable>
    </div>
</div>

Similarly, the other two are exactly reversed. The total amount of $f'$ flow going into $u$.

Therefore, everything got canceled.

$$
\sum_{(u, v) \in E}(f\uparrow f')(u, v) - \sum_{(v, u)\in E}(f\uparrow f')(v, u) = 0
$$

$$
|f\uparrow f'| = \sum_{(s, u)\in E} (f\uparrow f')(s, u)-\sum_{(u, s)\in E}(f\uparrow f')(u, s) \\
= \sum_{(s, u)\in E}(f(s, u)+f'(s, u)-f'(u, s)) - \sum_{(u, s)\in E}(f(u, s) + f'(u, s) - f'(s, u))\\
= |f| + |f'| => by \ definition \ of \ s, \ 0 \ to \ enter
$$

- **_Lemma 2_**

Given flow $f$ in $G$ and given any cut $(S, T)$, $f(S, T)=|f|$. => The net flow going out of the source is equal to the net flow going into the sink. (consider the $T = t$).

**_Proof_**

$$
f(S, T)=\sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T}(f(u, v)-f(v, u)) \\
=\sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in S}(f(u, v)-f(v, u)) + \sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T}(f(u, v)-f(v,u))
$$

The first term is 0 as when $(u, v)$ switched their roles in the sum, we are subtracting that term again. The first term can be understood that the sum of the edge that both endpoints are in ${S}$.

_Simplify_

$$
= \sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in V}(f(u, v)-f(v,u)) => Net \ Flow \ Going \ Out \ Of \ u \\
= |f|
$$

We have flow conservation in $u$. The net flow going out of $u$ is $0$ except possibly when $u$ is equal to $s$. So, the sum is the amount of flow going out of the source minus the amount of flow going into the source. And that is equal to the value of the flow.

- **_Corollary 1_**

For any flow $f$ and any cut $(S, T), |f|\le c(S, T)$. => The amount of flow that can go from $s$ (the value of the flow) is upper bounded by the capacity of the edges that go from $S$ to $T$, it is intuitively correct as the capacity is a bottleneck for how much flow you can send from $S \to T$.

**_Proof_**

$$
|f|=f(S, T) => Lemma \ 2 \\
= \sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T}((f(u, v) -f(v, u))) \\
\le \sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T}(c(u, v) - 0) \\
=c(S, T)
$$

_Now, let us state the max-flow-min-cut theorem._

- **_Max-flow-min-cut Theorem_**

_First, let us illustrate the corollary that we have proved above._

**_Illustrate the Corollary_**

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
		 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/B8H3Ute.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable>
    </div>
</div>

1. Put in all possible flow values that you can have in your graph.

2. Put in all the possible capacities of cuts that you can have.

_The corollary is saying that all the XS are to the left of all the circles. No flow value can be larger than any capacity of a cut._

_While the max-flow-min-cut theorem says that if you take the largest flow value here and you take the smallest capacity of the cut, they actually meet._

**_Statement_**

Let $f$ be a flow in $G$. Then the following 3 statements are equivalent.

1. $f$ is a max flow
2. there is no augmenting path (in $G_f$)
3. $\exist$ cut $(S, T)$ such that the value of the flow $|f|=c(S, T)$

_Why do we show interest in this theorem? What are the relationships between the FF method?_

- If Ford-Fulkerson terminates that means there's no augmenting path, then the max-flow-min-cut theorem tells $f$ is a max flow.

_The big question is, does FF always terminate?_

## Part 2

- **_Proof of Theorem_**

$1 \implies 2$ **_Contradiction + Lemma 1_**

Assume for contradiction that, <u>$f$ is a max flow and that there is an augmenting path $p$ (in $G_f$)</u>.

Then by **_Lemma 1_**, $f\uparrow f_p$ is a flow in $G$ of value $|f\uparrow f_p| = |f| + |f_p| > |f|$. This means, $f\uparrow f_p$ has a larger value.

However, $f$ is a max flow and that is contradicted by the assumption.

Therefore, $1\implies 2$.

---

$2 \implies 3$ **_Construct cut + Single Edge_**

Let $S=\{ v\in V|v \ is \ reachable \ from \ s \ in \ G_f  \}$. So $S$ is simply **the vertices that you can reach from the source** in the residual network by some path. <font face="Noto Serif SC">在残存网络中，集合S中的任意一个点到原点都有路径。</font> Let $T = V \setminus S$.

<u>_Now we need to argue that this is a cut._</u>

It is clearly a partition of the vertex set, but then we needed the source to be in $S$ and the sink to be in $T$.

_Is there a path is as reachable from $S$ in $G_f$ that clearly?_ => It just takes the empty path, so it clearly $s$ belongs to $S$.

_What about the sink being in the $T$?_ => $t\in T$ because otherwise $t$ would be reachable from $s$ in $G_f$, contradicting (2) => Augmenting path.

<u>_Therefore, the cut has been constructed. Then, we need to argue why $|f|=c(S, T)$._</u>

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
		 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NXOZ9mj.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable>
    </div>
</div>

Assume $(u, v) \in E$. Then $f(u, c)=c(u, v)$. Above.

Now assume $(v, u)\in E$. We take the same case in the opposite direction. Therefore, $f(v, u) = 0$.

Otherwise, _<u>v is reachable from s</u>_, which means $v \in S$.

By **_Lemma 2_**,

$$
|f| = f(S, T) = \sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T}(f(u, v)-f(v, u)) \\
= \sum_{u\in S}\sum_{v\in T}(c(u, v) - 0) = c(S, T)
$$

---

$3 \implies 1$ **_Corollary 1_**

Let $f'$ be any flow in $G$. By **_Corollary 1_**,

$$
|f'|\le c(S, T) => cut \ from \ Theorem(3) \\
=|f| \implies f \ is \ a \ max\ flow
$$

Therefore, $3\implies 1$.

---

**Running Time**

- **_How fast of FF method?_**

In general, F.F. does not terminate. => Capacities need to be irrational numbers for this to occur, otherwise, it always terminates.

**Assume <u>integer</u> capacities. Then F.F. has a running time $O(E\cdot |f^*|)$ where $f^*$ is a max flow.**

_Why it is true?_

If all the capacities are integers, we know that F.F increases the value of the flow by at least 1 in each step. Therefore, the number of iterations is bounded by the value of the max flow. And in each step, we need to find an augmenting path and you can do any linear time search procedure to find a path from $s\to t$.

<font face="Noto Serif SC">找增广路径的时间是线性的，边集合的大小。每次找到一个路径至少增加1，最多找到最大流的值个。</font>

_Is this fast or slow?_ => It depends on the value of the $|f^*|$, and also the $|E|$.

**Example**

Bad choice is every time, go through the middle path, then increment by 1 every time.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
		 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Of4oDQe.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable>
    </div>
</div>

Good choice is not selecting the middle path. Only takes 2 steps.

- **Edmonds-Karp(G)** => E.K. No matter about the capacities look like, including irrational numbers.

Then, we introduce an algorithm which is called **Edmonds-Karp**. It is an implementation that when selecting a path always chooses the shortest path, for example, the algorithm will select the length of the path equal to 2 instead of the bad one with 3.

1. $f \leftarrow 0$ => Initialize flow to be $0$.

2. while $\exists$ augmenting path

   let $p$ be a <u>shortest such path</u>

   $f\leftarrow f\uparrow f_p$

3. return $f$

- **_Theorem 1_**

The number of iterations of E.K. is $O(VE)$.

**_Proof_**

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
		 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HrjM9FM.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable>
    </div>
</div>

_Then, let's prove in each step, the #iteration is bounded by $O(E)$._

_But right now, we need to show that we cannot keep the distance the same for more than $O(E)$._

Consider consecutive flows $f_0, f_1, ...f_k$ found by E.K. such that the $\delta_{f_0}(s, t)=\delta_{f_1}(s, t) = ...=\delta_{f_k}(s, t)$.

For $d = 0, 1, ..., $ let $L_d=\{v\in V|\delta_{f_0}(s, v)=d \}$.

A forward edge of $G_{f_0}$ is an edge $(u, v)$ in $G_{f_0}$ such that $u \in L_d$, $v\in L_{d+1}$ for some $d$. A back edge of $G_{f_0}$ is the reverse of a forward edge.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
		 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BoNdoYS.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable>
    </div>
</div>

Forward edges are in blue, while $b \to c$ is not the forward edge as the distance from $s\to b=2$, $s\to c=1$.

- **_Claim 1_**

For $i=0, 1, ..., k$, E.K. finds an augmenting path in $G_{f_i}$ consisting only of forward edges of $G_{f_0}$.

**_Claim 1_** implies that $k=O(E)$ since at least one forward edge disappears in each iteration. (as in each step, we are removing at least 1 blue edge from the $G_{f_0}$. While the number of blue edges is smaller than the number of edges. Remove at least 1 forward edge because we can always remove the bottleneck forward edge by replacing it to be the back edge in each step.)

**_Proof_**

It is clear for $i=0$ as we can only use forward edges because it's the shortest path, we have to go one step forward each time.

$G_{f_1}$ is obtained from $G_{f_0}$ by removing forward edges and adding back edges since $\delta_{f_0}(s, t)=\delta_{f_1}(s, t)$ . Thus **_Claim 1_** true for $i=1$.

- **_Claim 2_** $\delta_{f_{k+1}}(s, t)\ge\delta_{f_k}(s, t)$

**_Proof_**

$G_{f_{k+1}}$ is obtained from $G_{f_0}$ by removing forward edges and inserting back edges. Thus **_Claim 2_** holds.

\*Then, claim 1 and 2 can imply the proof above. => **Theorem 1\***.

- **_Corollary 2_**

E.K. can be implemented to run in $O(VE^2)$. => BFS.

- **_Integrality Theorem_**

Given integer capacities, F.F. will find an integer-value flow $f$, with $|f|$ an integer.
