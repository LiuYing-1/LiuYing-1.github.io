To "celebrate" Jianxiang Yu's leaving, accompany Xuanlang Zhao, we invited them to <a href="https://www.tivoli.dk/?gclid=CjwKCAiAzKqdBhAnEiwAePEjkkNCCLulvpIQH-o8EmAQPiKdGUaNTz9pCCoCZBSeOKtVtuDSdX3NWhoCLkcQAvD_BwE">Tivoli</a> yesterday.

We experienced all the roller coasters, including Demon, the most exciting one! Additionally, we also took the flying chairs and a lot of other exciting things.

However, I still feel afraid to try the golden tower. Next time, I will definitely take it with Runfei Wu.

In the end, we witnessed a marvelous firework show set off by Tivoli.
