# Being the Chef

I would say that was sort of my first time cooking for so many people. I have tried many dishes and the results seem to be successful. For dinner, I have cooked <u>spicy cauliflower</u>, <u>soy mushroom</u>, <u>green pepper pork</u> and <u>potato slice</u>.

I appreciate the tietgenkolleigiet can offer me such precious opportunities to live here and have an excellent experience of socializing with my danish family!

If possible, I would like to continue living here with my danish family!
