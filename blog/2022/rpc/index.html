We want to isolate failures and make the entire system fault-tolerant. So, how can we isolate errors?</p> <h3 id="isolating-errors---enforced-modularity">Isolating Errors - Enforced Modularity</h3> <p>The basic idea of isolating errors is to use clients and services.</p> <p>One way to separate concerns. <strong><em>Restrict the communication to messages only</em></strong>, <strong><em>Client request/Service respond (or reply)</em></strong>, <strong><em>Conceptually client and service in different computers</em></strong></p> <p>The other way to separate concerns is to further sandbox these applications into different parts of the operating system so that they definitely cannot interact with each other as memory, even if they are running on the same machine, this is called virtualization so that it contains the components into sandboxes where they cannot harm anyone outside of the sandbox.</p> <p>The above two techniques are very normal to use. In this course, we would talk more about <em>Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</em>.</p> <h3 id="rpc---remote-procedure-call">RPC - Remote Procedure Call</h3> <p>WebService is a very good example to apply RPC.</p> <p>RPC is a way for <strong><em>clients and services to communicate with each other</em></strong>. Maybe breaking slightly the abstraction that <strong><em>communication only works by messages</em></strong>. RPC <strong><em>pretends that the two applications do run on the same computer</em></strong> even though in reality they don’t but they try to <em>hide the fact that messages are being sent over the network from the developers from these applications</em> (not fully understood here).</p> <div align="center"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6qVZA6T.png" alt="image-20221228164315658" style="zoom: 33%;" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable=""> </div> </div> </div> <p>Here is a good explanation of RPC in Chinese. Referenced Here: https://www.jianshu.com/p/7d6853140e13. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalling_(computer_science)" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia Definition of Marshall</a></p> <p><a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/187560185" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The other explanation for RPC</a></p> <hr> <p>In the context of RPC, a stub is <strong><em>a piece of code that acts as a client for remote service</em></strong>. It is responsible for <strong><em>marshaling (converting) the parameters of the call into a format that can be transmitted over the network to the remote service, and for unmarshalling (converting) the results of the call back into a form that can be understood by the calling program</em></strong>.</p> <p><strong><em>Stubs</em></strong> are used in RPC to allow client programs to call remote functions as if they were local, without having to worry about the details of network communications or the implementation of the remote service. This makes it easier to write distributed applications that can make use of services provided by other programs on different machines.</p> <p>My understanding is, first of all, the <strong><em>aim of RPC is to call the services of a remote server as if it were a local function</em></strong>. The client calls a remote function which is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET_CONNECTIONS(uid)</code> which has been mentioned above, then, the client part calls the local (client) stub, which will then <strong><em>package (Marshall) the parameters of the function call into a message and send it over the network to the server</em></strong>. The server will receive the message and the server stub will unpackage the marshaler requests. Then execute the requested function, and return the results back after the service stub marshaled reply, to the client in the form of another message. The client’s stub will then receive this message, extract the results, and pass them back to the calling program.</p> <font color="red">**Difference between RPC and local procedure call** and what can go wrong when a client crashes? What about when a server crashes?</font> <ol> <li>By using RPC, the probability of failure occurs that brings down the whole system gets reduced as they are individuals.</li> <li>RPC has longer latency.</li> <li>RPC introduced a new failure mode which is “no-response”.</li> <li>Some programming languages will not fit well or work well with RPC mode.</li> </ol> <h3 id="rpc-semantics">RPC semantics</h3> <p>Even though we can use the method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeout</code> to address the case of no response for a service, it is useless sometimes as what we can know from it is only there is something wrong with when performing the service. Hence, we still have some other approaches to address no-response cases.</p> <p><strong>At-least-once</strong> (Because the functions are pure, it is no worry to think about whether they will cause any side effects. Hence, keep sending the requests, at least receive one or more than one response.)</p> <p><em>Operation is idempotent</em>. Naturally occurs if side-effect free</p> <p>Stub just retries the operation -&gt; failures can still occur!</p> <p>Example: calculate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SQRT</code></p> <p><strong>At-most-once</strong> (It is possible to set the timeout of the service when there is no response to the client, the server replies to the error to the client, and then, the money may or may not be there. We do not need to send requests anymore.)</p> <p>Operation does have side-effects</p> <p>Stub must ensure duplicate-free transmission</p> <p>Example: transfer $100 from my account to yours</p> <p><strong>Exactly-once</strong> (Ideal case, impossible to implement.)</p> <p>Possible for certain classes of failures</p> <p>Stub &amp; service keep track (<em>durably</em>) of requests and responses</p> <p>Example: bank cannot develop amnesia!</p> <h3 id="rpc-and-naming">RPC and Naming</h3> <p>Typically, we need to take care of the naming when using the RPCs. We want to know where the service sits and normally there is standard integration with the name of the directory service.</p> <div align="center"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/98PAbLE.png" alt="image-20221228191230123" style="zoom:33%;" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable=""> </div> </div> </div> <p>The server first registers the service with a name into the directory service.

From the client/service perspective, the latency of a request is the time from issuing the request until the time the response is received from the service.</p> <p><strong>Throughput</strong> is a measure of the rate of useful work done by a service for some given workload of requests. In the camera example, the throughput we might care about is how many frames per second the system can process because it may determine what quality camera we want to buy.</p> <p>How many operations the service can process in a given unit of time?</p> <p><strong>Example of Throughput</strong></p> <hr> <p><em>Consider a computer system with two stages: one that is able to process data at a rate of 1,000 kilobytes per second and a second one at a rate of 100 kilobytes per second. If the fast stage generates one byte of output for each byte of input, the overall throughput must be less than or equal to 100 kilobytes per second. If there is negligible overhead in passing requests between the two stages, then the throughput of the system is equal to the throughput of the bottleneck stage, 100 kilobytes per second. In this case, the utilization of stage 1 is 10% and that of stage 2 is 100%.</em></p> <p><em>When a stage processes requests serially, the throughput and the latency of a stage are directly related. The average number of requests a stage handles is inversely proportional to the average time to process a single request:</em></p> \[throughput = \frac{1}{latency}\] <p>However, it does not hold when there is concurrency. It only works on only single thread.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Scalability</strong> is the measure of a system’s ability to increase or decrease in performance and cost in response to changes in application and system processing demands. Examples would include how well a hardware system performs when the number of users is increased, how well a database withstands growing numbers of queries, or how well an operating system performs on different classes of hardware. Enterprises that are growing rapidly should pay special attention to scalability when evaluating hardware and software.</p> <h3 id="common-issues-with-performance-metrics">Common Issues with Performance Metrics</h3> <p><strong>Properties of resources and/or services</strong></p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Utilization, Capacity</strong></p> <p>How many requests or how many ports can be accepted or held? =&gt; Capacity</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Overhead, throughput, latency</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Scalability</strong></p> </li> </ol> <p><strong>Considering scalability alone is dangerous.</strong></p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/irOrf0o.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable=""> </div> </div> <p>Here is an example that choosing B might be the best option.</p> <h3 id="riding-moores-law">Riding Moore’s Law</h3> <p>CPU clock speed does not get better anymore.</p> <p>Memory size, Memory bandwidth, disk size, and disk bandwidth are still improved a lot (50%), while memory latency (1%) and disk latency go slower (10%).</p> <h3 id="performance-and-hardware-trends">Performance and Hardware Trends</h3> <div align="center"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7eRRg3q.png" alt="image-20221229175058392" style="zoom: 33%;" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable=""> </div> </div> </div> <div align="center"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/D0qVqcT.png" alt="image-20221229180314186" style="zoom: 33%;" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable=""> </div> </div> </div> <div align="center"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fjXnqkv.png" alt="image-20221229180225002" style="zoom: 33%;" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable=""> </div> </div> </div> <p>This is very close to the real computer.

A designer may observe that certain requests are more common than other requests, and use that observation to improve the performance of frequent operations by splitting the staged pipeline into a fast path for frequent requests and a slow path for other requests.</p> <h4 id="fast-path-coding">Fast-path Coding</h4> <p><strong>Fast-path coding</strong> splits processing into two code paths.</p> <div align="center"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lSBnydN.png" alt="image-20221229182415410" style="zoom: 33%;" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" data-zoomable=""> </div> </div> </div> <p>One optimized path for common requests is a <strong>fast path</strong>.</p> <p>One slow but comprehensive path for all other requests is a <strong>slow path</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Caching</strong> is an example of fast-path coding.</p> <h4 id="batching">Batching</h4> <p>It runs multiple requests at once. Collect requests and execute them only once. Batch-I/Os is a good example of batching with the Elevator algorithm. It may improve latency and throughput.</p> <p>批处理是指计算机用来周期性地完成大量重复数据作业的方法。某些数据处理任务（如备份、筛选和排序）可能需要大量计算，而且在单个数据事务上运行效率很低。相反，数据系统通常可以在计算资源更普遍可用的非高峰时间批量处理这些任务，例如一天结束时或夜间。例如，考虑一个全天接收订单的电子商务系统。系统可能会在每天结束时收集所有订单，并用一个批处理与订单履行团队共享，而不是在发生时处理每个订单。</p> <p><em>Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/cn/what-is/batch-processing/</em></p> <h4 id="dallying">Dallying</h4> <p>It is delaying a request on the change that the operation won’t be needed, or to create more opportunities for batching. For example, a stage may delay a request that overwrites a disk block in the hope that a second one will come along for the same block. If a second one comes along, the stage can delete the first request and perform just the second one. As applied to writes, this benefit is sometimes called write absorption.</p> <p>Dallying also increases the opportunities for batching. It purposely increases the latency of some requests in the hope that more requests will come along that can be combined with the delayed requests to form a batch. In this case, dallying increases the latency of some requests to improve the average latency of all requests.</p> <p>A key design question in dallying is to decide how long to wait. There is no generic answer to this question. The costs and benefits of dallying are application and system specific.</p> <p>Typical Example: <strong>Group Git</strong></p> <h4 id="parallelism">Parallelism</h4> <p>Increase the performance of hardware and the number of cores.</p> <h4 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h4> <p>Run multiple requests in different threads</p> <p><strong>Example</strong>: different web requests run in different threads or even servers</p> <p>May improve both throughput and latency, but must be careful with locking correctness.</p> <h4 id="speculation">Speculation</h4> <p>Predict the future. Guess the next requests and run them in advance. Prefetching is an example. May overlap expensive operations, instead of waiting for their completion.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Y.
